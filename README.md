### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
-ðŸ”­ I am currently in grade 11, at Colegio Seminario De Duitama.
-ðŸŒ± I am currently learning many things, since being a student can acquire knowledge of different subjects of all subjects, English, programming, mathematics, and I really like to acquire new knowledge. 
-ðŸ‘¯ I am looking to collaborate in community works for people who need it since that is what I want to dedicate myself to, to help those who need me. 
-ðŸ¤” I am looking for help to be able to create a good life project, to pass in a good university, where I can stand out very well.
-ðŸ“« I live in Duitama, so it's quite easy to locate me, since it's a bit small place, so you usually know and know most people. 
-ðŸ˜„ I'm usually called Cielito, which sounds quite tender and cute. 
-âš¡ I'm very dedicated, and I really like to strive for what I want until I achieve it.
